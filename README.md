## Dependencies - ðŸŽ¨ ASCII GUI with Tkinter & PyFiglet

---

### ðŸ’» Installation (macOS & Linux)

Follow these steps in your terminal:

1. **Install Python** (if not already installed):

   - macOS:
     ```bash
     brew install python
     ```

   - Linux (Ubuntu/Debian):
     ```bash
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
     ```

2. **Install tkinter** (GUI library):

   - macOS (Homebrew Python only):
     ```bash
     brew install python-tk
     ```

   - Linux:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install python3-tk
     ```

3. **Install pyfiglet**:

   ```bash
   pip3 install pyfiglet

## Running ASAP tool
To run the tool run

     ```bash
     cd src/
     python3 ASAPGuiWrapper.py
     ```
This would open-up a GUI interface as shown below

### Drop-down Menu Options

#### 1. ASAP Insertion

This option is used during the **pre-silicon design phase**. It allows you to insert logic hooks into your source files based on pragma specifications.

**Inputs required:**

- **Specification file**  
  A sample specification file can be found at `src/asap_params.spec`. (Refer to the paper for more details.)

- **Output directory**  
  Directory where the modified source files will be saved.

---

#### 2. ASAP Compiler

This option compiles patch programs and generates bitstream files used to program the ASAP architecture.

**Inputs required:**

- **Specification file**  
  Sample: `src/asap_params.spec`

- **Output folder**  
  Directory where the generated bitstream files will be saved.

- **Interface file**  
  Metadata from ASAP Insertion showing available signals and their hierarchy. This would be generated by ASAP Insertion tool.

- **SRU program file**  
  SRU patch code that needs to be compiled. Samples in `asap_sample/remediation_programs`

- **SMU program file**  
  SMU patch code that needs to be compiled. Samples in `asap_sample/remediation_programs`

## Patch Simulation

The ASAP Compiler generates the bitstream files `patch.asap.smu` and `patch.asap.sru`. These bitstream files need to be streamed serially to the `asapTop` top-level source file, which is generated by ASAP Insertion.

Sample test-benches demonstrating this process can be found in the `asap_sample/tests/` directory.
